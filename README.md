## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to implement a **Library Book Management System** using:
- A **single linked list** to manage book records dynamically.
- A **stack** to record and undo recent issue or return transactions.

This simulates a real-world library management scenario and helps in understanding basic data structures in practice.


## Features
1. Insert Book – Add a new book to the library.  
2. Delete Book – Remove a book from the library using Book ID.  
3. Search Book – Search for a specific book by Book ID.  
4. Issue Book – Mark a book as issued and record the transaction.  
5. Return Book – Mark a book as returned and record the transaction.  
6. Undo Transaction – Revert the last issue or return action.  
7. View All Books – Display all books currently in the library.  
8. View Transactions – Show all recent transactions stored in the stack.
